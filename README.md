A cutting-edge recommendation system for the **MovieLens(small)** dataset! üé¨

Recommendation systems have become a cornerstone of modern digital experiences, helping users discover products, services, and content tailored to their preferences.

The project focuses on delivering highly personalized movie recommendations.

We developed a sophisticated recommendation system utilizing two key approaches:

**1- User-Based Models with Deep Factorization Machine:**

This model captures the intricate relationships between users and items by learning deep interactions from the data. It allows us to provide personalized recommendations by understanding user preferences and predicting ratings for unseen movies.

**2- Item-Based Models with Cosine Similarity:**

By leveraging cosine similarity, we measure the likeness between items based on user ratings and genres. This approach helps in recommending movies that are similar to those a user has liked before.

**Features of Our Dashboard:**

To enhance user experience, we created an interactive dashboard using Dash, featuring two main pages:

**1-User Pageüë•:**

Personal History: Users can select their ID to view their movie-watching history.

Custom Recommendations: Users can choose the number of recommendations they want, and the system displays posters of top-rated movies similar to their history.

**2-Movie PageüçøüìΩÔ∏è:**

Title-Based Recommendations: Users can select a movie title and get recommendations based on either the movie ratings or similar genres.
